# Medical Data Science


This lecture on Medical Data Science highlights the transformative potential of data science and statistical machine learning in healthcare. It emphasizes efficient handling of large biological datasets to build statistical models for insights generation, hypothesis testing, and decision support in medicine. Key topics covered include gaining insights from medical data, addressing uncertainty in models, and developing interpretable decision support systems. Methodologies discussed include GWAS analysis with LMMs, sequence analysis with kernel methods, approaches for "small $n$ problems," data integration methods, probabilistic Machine Learning models, and deep learning for large datasets.
