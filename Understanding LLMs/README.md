# Understanding LLMs

The course “Understanding LLMs”, taught at University of Tübingen, focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-x or LLama. It covers topics that will equip participants with a better conceptual and practical understanding of what LLMs are, how they work, and how to understand them. In the course, we will look (among others) at LLM architecture, training & fine-tuning, prompting, mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, LLM agents and different evaluation methods. Participants will be offered both a technical perspective and encouraged to critically think about important topics relevant to cognitive science and society in the context of LLMs.
