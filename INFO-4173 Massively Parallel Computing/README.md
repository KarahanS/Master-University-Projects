# INFO-4173 Massively Parallel Computing


Graphics processors contain thousands of parallel processing elements and thus enable us to explore this realm of massively parallel computing.
The high number of parallel cores poses a great challenge for software design that must expose massive parallelism to benefit from the new hardware.
The main purpose of the lecture is to teach practical algorithm design for such parallel hardware.
* Introduction to Parallel Computing
* Basic Algorithms:
    * Map, reduce, parallel branching, sorting
    * Parallel data storage and retrieval
* Parallel Computation:
    * FFT, particle systems
    * Parallel linear equation solvers, parallel PDEs
    * Parallel complexity analysis and profiling
    * System integration and graphics processor clusters
    
This year the course is offered as a one-week block course.
